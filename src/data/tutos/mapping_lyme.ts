    description: `
The *Semantic Web* contains a vast and interconnected set of resources. For a single disease like **Lyme disease**, multiple descriptions and identifiers may exist across various ontologies. To understand how entities are semantically connected, we will investigate how Lyme disease is represented and linked starting from the **Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO)**.  
  - 
The objective of this tutorial is to retrieve and explore information about Lyme disease. We will start from the ORDO ontology and use its resource describing Lyme disease as an entry point. From there, we will see how to expand our understanding of the disease using semantic connections and external references.
